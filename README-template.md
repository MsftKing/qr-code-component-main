## My process

In order to achieve this look I used the files provided in AdobeXD, to ensure the min and max sizes dependent on the view sourcing were accurate. Using the Adobe file I am able to accurately see what the end goal was and plan the execution of the task.

Once I have written down the scale and view-height and width and any other information that is important to the process I begin to work in my IDE of choice, Visual Studio Code.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned that I can deploy functional sites using semantic HTML5 and focusing appealing to accessibility in all of my coding. In doing so I make sure those that use software to read their screens or help them open sites are able to use and view all aspects of the site.

### Continued development

I would like to add Javascript in the futre to turn this into a more interactable site with the ability to link the QR to personal information that pertains to a client. It would be an easy way for personal businesses to share their information if this was on a business card styled layout.
